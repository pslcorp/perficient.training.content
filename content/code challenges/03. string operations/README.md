## Exercise
Write a method that receive 4 names and concatenate it to print a full name with the following structure.

```c#
"Hello Tonny Anderson Stark Rogers" 
```

Just to see how the different ways to concatenate strings work in C# create a method for each of the approaches mentioned on the official [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/how-to/concatenate-multiple-strings).
 
The idea here is to evaluate the performance of those separate methods by using [benchmark](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/overview.html).
